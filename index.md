#### Summary
_We make that call, that you never have time or do not want to_.  Then we send you a text / email of the results.  You simply type repeat transaction, and we 
will repeat it, or if you want to try different routes we can do those as well.  We are unable to give legal advice, but we can explain scenarios of past projects and their outcome.


Below are some senarios we handle:


- [ ] Federal Agencies / IRS Calls 
- [ ] State Government / Tax Calls
- [ ] Local Government Agencies 
- [ ] Company calls

What we charge is a [nominal setup fee]($50) this covers your setup, and phone configurations.  Where you point us the number and 
tell us the desired outcome you wish.

because we allow them to do what they do best, and allow us to handle the phones and the follow-up calls that proceed.
